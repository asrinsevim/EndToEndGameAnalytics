## üöÄ Project Summary

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline that processes live event data for a mobile game. It showcases a complete workflow from data collection in **Firebase** to transformation in **BigQuery** and final visualization in a **Looker Studio** dashboard, providing actionable insights for business stakeholders such as product managers and marketing teams.

---

## üìä Live KPI Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was created in Looker Studio to provide a high-level overview of the game's daily performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

The data flows through a modern, cloud-based analytics architecture:

1.  **Data Collection:** A Python script simulates player activity and sends events directly to a live Firebase project using the **Google Analytics Measurement Protocol**.
2.  **Automated Data Export:** The native **Firebase-to-BigQuery integration** is enabled, which automatically exports raw, nested event data to BigQuery tables on a daily basis.
3.  **Data Warehousing:** **Google BigQuery** is used as a scalable, high-performance cloud data warehouse to store the raw event logs.
4.  **Data Transformation:** An advanced **SQL query** runs in BigQuery to transform the raw, nested JSON data into a clean, aggregated `daily_kpi_summary` table.
5.  **Data Visualization:** The final KPI table in BigQuery is connected to **Looker Studio** to build the interactive business intelligence dashboard.

## ‚ú® Key Technical Features

* **Live Data Ingestion:** Utilized Python and the Google Analytics Measurement Protocol to send event data to a live Firebase project.
* **Automated Cloud ETL:** Leveraged the native Firebase-to-BigQuery integration to automate the daily export of raw data.
* **Advanced SQL Transformation:** Wrote a multi-CTE (Common Table Expression) SQL query to handle a complex, real-world data problem.
    * **Parsed Nested JSON:** Successfully parsed and extracted values from the nested `event_params` schema native to Firebase exports.
    * **Data Flattening:** Used `CROSS JOIN UNNEST` to transform granular event data into an analyzable format.
* **Interactive BI Dashboard:** Created a professional dashboard in Looker Studio from scratch, featuring high-level KPI scorecards, time-series charts, and interactive date range filters.
